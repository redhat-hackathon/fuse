# Red Hat Fuse for Integration

## What is it?

Red Hat Fuse is a distributed, cloud-native integration solution that has the flexibility to service diverse users - including integration experts, application developers, and business users - each with their own choice of which deployment, architecture, and tooling. Fuse is based on the popular [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) open source project and offers a wide range of connectors, integration and transformation patterns.
